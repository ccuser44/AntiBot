<p align="center">The newest way to detect scam bots in your Roblox game using machine learning</p>

# About

You know those scam bots, right? The ones that join your game and chat messages to scam links over and over again. We know that these links do not give out the promised "reward", well, at least most of us do. It's really hard to detect if a user is a scam bot or not, since the bots can always change their meathod of "attack". By using machine learning, we can pool together tons of data to help make it easier to detect bots.

# Installation

Take the model from [here](https://www.roblox.com/library/6568673615/AntiBot), and open the README script located under the model.

## Steps

1. Bring "AntiBotMain" into "ServerScriptService"
2. Modify the settings in "AntiBotMain" to your liking
3. **ENABLE HTTP REQUESTS (under game settings)**. If this step is not done, the module won't be able to function
4. Watch the scam bots go down!
