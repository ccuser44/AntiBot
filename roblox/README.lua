        The easiest way to keep scam bots out of your game - Created by lxgh1lxy
	
AntiBot uses machine learning to determine the chance that a user that joins your game is a bot. AntiBot also includes a report feature, which helps the AI (Artificial Intelligence) preform better at finding bots.

		SETUP:
	- ENABLE HTTP REQUESTS (under game settings). If this step is not done, the module won't be able to function
	- Modify the settings in "AntiBotMain" to your liking
	- Watch the scam bots go down!
	
Thanks for using AntiBot!
